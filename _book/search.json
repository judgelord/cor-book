    "text": "Electoral Security Staff Capacity District Need Other Legislator Factors Other Institutional Factors Specific Agencies for Case Studies Individual constituency service (1) Yes–but logic of this depends on visibility of constituent service (or at least recipients of service telling others about it), so if this form of representation isn’t “visible,” then maybe not\nYes: populations (veterans, immigrants, seniors) Yes: descriptive representation (race, gender, veteran status)\nVA, USCIS Corporate constituency service (2) Yes (donors)\nNonprofit/local government service (3)\nYes: universities, local govt. needs; organized interests may also play a role\nSome DOT subagencies mention specific local governments applying for grants Corporate policy (4) Yes (donors)\nPolicy (5)\nWould probably matter for all of these? Would depend on the makeup of each legislator’s staff - do we have a way to measure this?\nLowande et al. (2019) look at contacts without differentiating them by type as we do, so descriptive representation may matter for policy as well (and based on other literature) Yes: minority party legislators may be more likely to exert influence over policy through the bureaucracy since their ability to do so legislatively is limited\nParty of the president may also matter: opposite-party legislators may do more monitoring of the executive branch by contacting the bureaucracy\nChapter 2: Theory\n[do more to explain why we are looking at distinct and sometimes-overlapping explanations for each type of invisible representation: need to explain that these are fundamentally different activities but, for many reasons, not mutually exclusive: e.g. given the appropriate staffing capacity, electoral concerns, and district needs, a legislator could do both a lot of constituent service and policy contact–maybe mostly because these are done by different parts of their offices and are just designed to serve different purposes?] * Fenno and other research on representational/staffing/etc. “styles”: like these other behaviors, the representational behaviors that we are studying can be idiosyncratic and dependent upon a number of different factors\nThe activities that we have described as “invisible representation” can serve a number of functions for members of Congress. Contact with the bureaucracy on behalf of individuals for the purpose of constituency service allows legislators to monitor the functioning of the bureaucracy, as occurred in 2020 when constituents reported delays involving the U.S. Postal Service and members of Congress wrote to USPS demanding answers for their constituents. [maybe also mention something about the 2014 VA scandal here to illustrate the importance of the bureaucracy functioning properly?] And while legislators often make these contacts public through their constituent communications [cite the paper with Jessie and/or Jessie’s research here], this “invisible representation” also affords legislators opportunities to engage in work that is more difficult for the public to scrutinize. Beyond advocating for constituents, which is seen as a core component of legislators’ jobs, legislators may also advocate on behalf of donors or push for policies out of direct view of the public eye.\nWhat explains these inequalities in invisible representation? Our theory highlights electoral security, staff capacity, and district demand as the main potential drivers of legislators’ contacts with the bureaucracy for various purposes, as well as the idiosyncrasies of individual legislators as a potential alternative explanation. However, in contrast to previous research that has examined how these and other factors motivate legislators’ public-facing activities, we identify the unique ways in which these factors may also motivate behind-the-scenes representational work. The nature of our data also allows us to examine the relationship between Congress and the bureaucracy in a less common light—namely, how individual legislators seek to influence the bureaucracy, as opposed to how Congress as an institution interacts with the bureaucracy.\n[could almost frame this as a contrast to other studies that look at legislators’ motivations for engaging in public-facing activities like floor speeches or constituent communications - e.g. Maltzman and Sigelman 1996, Grimmer 2013, others]\n\nConstituent service is both a way for legislators to monitor the functioning of the bureaucracy and to gain support from constituents. Legislators might do more policy work in areas in which they also do more constituent service because of high constituent demand, problems within the bureaucracy, or personal interest in that policy area. Could also do this for electoral reasons, but if constituent service works that way already (evidence is mixed), more policy work might not be necessary (especially if we use policy-related letters as the measure - that’s more behind-the-scenes work).\nElectoral/party fundraising concerns would be the main factor on the donor side. Legislators might do more policy work in areas in which they also write more to agencies on behalf of donors to signal their investment in these policy areas.\n\nCongress, the Bureaucracy, and “Invisible Representation”\nOur data on legislators’ communications with federal agencies allow us to depart from previous studies that have primarily examined how Congress as an institution affects the bureaucracy, particularly the implementation of policy (e.g. Acs 2019; Clinton, Lewis, and Selin 2014; MacDonald 2013), and instead examine how individual legislators pursue a broader array of goals through this work. An emerging literature has focused on communications between individual legislators and the bureaucracy, showing that these contacts can be a vehicle for descriptive representation (Lowande, Ritchie, and Lauterbach 2019) and distributive benefits or “letter-marking” (Mills and Kalaf-Hughes 2015; Mills, Kalaf-Hughes, and MacDonald 2016).\n\nPrevious work has explored how Congress as an institution can influence the actions of the bureaucracy:\nCongress has less influence over bureaucratic policy when a greater number of committees is involved in the process (Clinton, Lewis, and Selin 2014) (but this research is mostly at the committee level [focuses on the structure of the committee system] and does not consider individual legislators’ attempts to influence bureaucratic policy)\nCongress exerts influence over bureaucratic policy through limitation riders, particularly under divided government (MacDonald 2013)\nCongress can also influence bureaucratic policy through legislative vetoes, also under divided government (Acs 2019)\n\n[also mention other studies that have looked at contacts between individual legislators and the bureaucracy: Lowande, Ritchie, and Lauterbach (2019), Mills and Kalaf-Hughes, others]\nWhat Explains Inequalities in Invisible Representation?\nExisting research suggests a number of factors that are likely to affect how legislators represent constituents, advocate on behalf of their donors, and work to advance policy goals through their contact with the bureaucracy. Some are factors specific to individual legislators like electoral concerns, personal characteristics, and district need, while others, like staff capacity or majority/minority party status, are more closely tied to Congress as an institution. Electoral Security Building on Mayhew’s (1974) argument that legislators pursue re-election as a goal through credit-claiming and position-taking, as well as allocating money to their districts, scholarship has explored re-election as an explanation for various types of legislative behavior. Constituency service has long been assumed to be a key part of the “personal vote” that helps legislators gain support from constituents in a way that is less closely related to policy (Cain, Ferejohn, and Fiorina 1987; Fiorina 1977). Early research supports the idea that providing constituency service has electoral benefits for legislators (e.g. Serra and Cover 1992; Serra and Moon 1994), and more recent work shows that, regardless of whether constituents may still respond to constituency service in this way, legislators behave as though constituency service has electoral benefits (Dropp and Peskowitz 2012), just as senators tailor their constituency communications based on their electoral security (Grimmer 2013). However, there is also some contemporary evidence that greater electoral security is associated with greater constituency service responsiveness (Butler, Karpowitz, and Pope 2012).\n[something about how the behind-the-scenes nature of our data may affect legislators’ strategically responding to constituency service requests - while everything our data captures is an actual response to an inquiry from a constituent, it may also include repeated contacts in ways that can capture the complexity of a single case and the amount of time and resources that the legislator and their staff are dedicating to constituency service? Maybe also bring in Butler and Broockman (2011) here and discuss their finding that legislators are not strategically discriminating in their responses]\nFewer studies have examined how these forms of representation may work together, but Harden (2013) argues that legislators emphasize policy, service, allocation, and descriptive representation according to their electoral needs. Butler, Karpowitz, and Pope (2012) find that, in general, legislators are more responsive to service-related requests from constituents than they are to policy-related requests, with this pattern being particularly pronounced among Democrats in Congress. Staff Capacity As we have established, congressional staff play a major role in the provision of constituency service. For this reason, staff capacity is likely to be particularly important for legislators’ communications with the bureaucracy on behalf of both individuals and other constituents, like nonprofit organizations and local governments, whose requests may require specialized knowledge among congressional staff.\n\nCrosson et al. (2021) show that legislative capacity, as measured using congressional staff, has withered over time among legislators of both parties; correspondingly, constituency service staff capacity has increased. They attribute this decline in legislative capacity to “centralized legislative power in an era of insecure majorities” (747).\n[this may be more useful in setting up why constituency service matters?]\n\nExisting work suggests that staff capacity is also likely to matter for legislators’ policy-related communications with the bureaucracy. 3. Experience among senior committee staff matters for committees’ legislative productivity (Ommundsen 2023), suggesting that individual legislators with similarly experienced staff may also be more productive in a variety of ways. [what are the implications of this finding for our data? Would more experience among senior policy staff make legislators more or less likely to contact the bureaucracy about policy matters? Would this work in the same way for constituent service?] 4. Butler, Karpowitz, and Pope (2012) find that the structure of legislative offices affects their responsiveness to constituency service and policy inquiries (interns remarked that supervisor approval was often required for responses to policy letters)\nDistrict Need\nOther Legislator-Related Factors\nOther Institutional Factors\n\nWhy would some legislators do more of these activities than other legislators? What explains inequality in representation?\nGender and race:\nBan and Kaslovsky (2024)\nEatough and Preece (2024) find that traditional measures of legislative effectiveness, which focus on bill sponsorship and passage alone, undervalue the work of women legislators and Black legislators, whose work in the legislative process involves less visible tactics such as cosponsorship and amendments.\nIdeology:\nAlexander, Berry, and Howell (2016) - greater ideological extremity = less federal money\nMajority/minority party status (especially for policy)\nMajority party status is a key determinant of legislative effectiveness, defined as a legislator’s ability to move bills through the legislative process (Volden and Wiseman 2014). As a result, minority party legislators may be more likely to use back-channel means of advancing their policy and representational goals.\nDistrict need/demand (for individual, corporate, and nonprofit/local government constituency service)\nConstituency service:\nDistrict demand\nStaff structure?\nElectoral concerns (though evidence that constituency service helps with re-election is mixed)\n501c3/local government service:\nDistrict need\nCooperation within state delegations? [would we expect these actions to be coordinated? Do we actually see such coordination in our data?]\nElectoral concerns\nKaslovsky and Stone (2024)\nLeah Rosenstiel’s paper from our MPSA panel will help with this (even if we can’t cite it yet)\nOrganized interests? Lowry and Potoski (2004)\nFor nonprofits and local governments, district need may also appear in the form of organized interests that are active in legislators’ districts or as part of their donor base.\nType of agency? Anderson and Potoski (2016) (although the breadth of our data across agencies may make this point unnecessary)\nChamber differences - Lee (2004) finds that senators have an easier time claiming credit for grants than House members (more useful for House members to pursue earmarks)\nAlso Bertelli and McCann (2018)\nCorporate constituency service and policy:\nElectoral/party fundraising concerns\nPolicy:\nPartisan control of the presidency (see above)\nCongressional gridlock - non-legislative solutions more likely (Bolton 2022)\nLowande and Potter (2019)\nGuenther and Searle (2019) find a trade-off between policy work and earmarks (not sure where this would fit in our theory)",
